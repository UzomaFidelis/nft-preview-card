## My process

I completed this solution following the same process I usually take for frontend projects. I started off writing all (at least most of it; I came back to add or remove elements as I continued) the html. Having the image and text on the screen I then used the css to adjust the positioning of the elements and to add colour, margin, padding as necessary. I did all this initially looking at the result on an emulated mobile viewport provided by the browser. Once I was satisfied with the result I started changing the screen size to see if it affected anything; this resulted in me making changes to the initial css. I used the media query to change a few things for larger screen sizes. Last thing I did was implement the view svg icon overlay on the image on hover (this was challenging for me to figure out so I left it for last). That's pretty much it. While noting that there are many areas where I'm not too confortable and need to improve (working on this showed me those area I need to learn about), I'm happy with the result. If you're reading this, please have a look at the html and css I wrote (if you can spare the time) and leave your tips and recommendations on my frontendmentor page for this solution. I'll love to hear what areas you think I should improve. Thanks ðŸ˜‰


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have learnt quite a bit about the 'position' property in css and using it to place divs, images and other elements where you want. Using 'position:absolute' was tricky for me at first but I am beginning to understand how it works.

Overlaying the view icon (with the colour effect) on hovering over the image was the real challenging part for me while working on this project. With the help of very useful resources on the internet I was able to do it and can confidently implement something similar in future projects. 


### Continued development

- I need to learn more about using css grid and flexbox. Had to learn a bit about the flexbox while working on this, my knowledge on its use is still very limited. I briefly looked at example codes using css grid and it is definitely something I have to learn. 

- Although I used the css 'transform' on this work, I don't really understand how it works. I just happened to see it in an example on one of the resources in looked at which implemented something similar to what I was aiming for.


### Useful resources

The W3schools website was very crucial to the completion of this solution. It really got me unstuck a couple of times during the course of the work, when things didn't seem to align how I wanted them to. Needless to say I couldn't have completed this solution without this resource. I also learned a lot of other stuff (not used on this particular solution) browsing for answers on the site. Some of the pages I found particularly helpful are:

- [image overlay resource](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This helped me create the :hover icon overlay on the image.

- [Responsiveness using media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me to adjust the look of the design on a large screen.

- [CSS Flexbox Resource](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me align some of the elements in the design side-by-side.

I want to thank the community of developers on stackoverflow. I can always rely on them to have answers (or something to close to help me on my way) to my questions when I get stuck.
